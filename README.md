My first text adventure game for Game Technology


So with this project I struggled with the concepts of the game engine at first because I got behind but after completing the project it makes a lot more sense to have
the engine seperate from the description. My game that I made here has you start in the middle of an abandoned mall and you wonder around seeing different abandoned stores until you try to find your way out. I give hints on directions of where to go in the description but I wanted to make it obvious where to through the description. If I could
add more to this game I would probably want to add a more compelx layout to the mall possible involving multiple floors and interactions where you can go inside a store and maybe grab something to help you get into another store. But since this is already a bit late this is the base version for the game. hope you like it.
